For cross linking pages with <link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com" hreflang="en-us" />


There are 2 ways:
1. languages are stored in /_data/lang/<FILE>.json
2. manual list

(1)
`all` is all languages supported
'level1' is a primary group of languages with get priority translations

You can add other files if you need other language subgroupings. Follow the format in `all.json`

To activate the cross linking, on a per page basis, set the `alternate:`
front matter to the name of the data file you want to use the langauge from
e.g.
---
alternate: all
---

or
---
alternate: level1
---

(2)
Manually list the lang codes in front matter as an array
---
alternate:
  - af
  - be
  - de
---
